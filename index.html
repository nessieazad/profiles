                    The goat or domestic goat is a domesticated species of goat-antelope typically kept as livestock. It
                    was domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of
                    the animal family Bovidae and the tribe Caprini, meaning it is closely related to the sheep.

Unti, one day my partner insist me to learn it and explained the benefits of knowing this field or course. And here I am starting my new journey.
